Machine learning for adaptive mesh refinement

1. regression.py - Fully Connected Network (can be modified easily to do classification)
2. regression_cnn.py - Convolutional Neural Network (can be modified easily to do classification)
3. regression_cnn_slices.py - Convolutional Neural Network which takes in slices of the flow field as input.
